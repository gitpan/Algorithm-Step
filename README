WHAT IS IT
==========

This is for observing the behavior of algorithms on some algorithm textbooks,
such as `The Art of Computer Programming', `Introduction to Algorithms'.
I write it only for fun. I have been thinking of how to embed documents
in program in a helpful way. I am very eager to hear your ideas on this
topic.

See `perldoc Algorithm::Step` for usage.

INSTALL
=======

tar -xvzf Algorithm-Step-<version>.tar.gz
cd Algorithm-Step-<version>
perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build test
perl Build install

You should have Module::Build installed in your system. If not, try

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Enjoy.
